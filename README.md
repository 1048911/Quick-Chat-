# Quick-Chat


An app that allows users to register, log in, and participate in a chat in real-time.

This app has multiple views and conforms to MVC. The view was designed using Autolayout and UIKit. I used Cocoapods to install Firebase and SVProgressHUD. Firebase is used to let users register an account and sign into an account. Firebase is also used to save messages to an online database. TableViews are used to display messages between senders.
